Data Sience projects are simple projects
1- I start by reading the data and knowing what it is talking about
2- I start see and check Outliers or not
3- I start cleaning  data and understand what each column is talking about , and I do know how to search for it and see how to benefit from it
4- I start putting my questions
5-Filter the questions one by one and start answering the questions
